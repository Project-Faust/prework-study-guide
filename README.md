# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description


This project is designed to showcase and list some of the basic knowledge regarding the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git in a simple web application. This project was the first step in learning how to use these tools and will be the foundation on top of which I hope to build an ever-growing skillset that I can make a career out of. The prework study guide introduced me to, and helped me understand, some of the changes and adaptations to the mindset of a problem-solver and a developer. Though the application is basic and non-interactive outside of refreshing the page to return a random topic in the console log, it allowed me to begin to develop a basic understanding of how the different languages and tools within them can be used.
